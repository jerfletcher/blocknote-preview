# Test Document

This is the main content of the document. The front matter above should be hidden in the BlockNote editor but preserved when saving.

## Features

* Front matter should be invisible in the editor

* Content should render normally

* When saved, front matter should be preserved

## Testing

1. Open this file with BlockNote

2. You should NOT see the front matter (the YAML between --- lines)

3. Edit the content below

4. Save and check that front matter is still present

This content is below the front matter and should be visible and editable in BlockNote.
